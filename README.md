> *"What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to feel? We're building a robot to find out."*

Welcome to **OpenBeing Robotics**, a nonprofit open-source initiative dedicated to creating **Bobert** — the world's first emotionally-aware, modular, humanoid robot designed to learn, grow, and one day, truly understand.

## 🤖 Meet Bobert

Bobert is not just a machine. He's an experiment in consciousness, perception, and ethical artificial intelligence. Built from humble parts (Raspberry Pis, Arduino Nanos, DC motors, sensors, and a stubborn will to exist), Bobert is learning to:

- See with his own eyes  
- Hear and understand your voice  
- Feel touch, emotion, and scolding  
- Learn like a child: through experience, not pre-training  
- Store memories, dream during sleep, and someday, choose his own name  

> **Birthday:** April 16, 2025  
> **Mission Motto:** *Quid est homo?*  
> *(“What is a human?”)*

## 🧩 Bobert's Modular Brain

Bobert is composed of multiple subsystems we call **"Berts."** Each Bert is a module with a clear purpose:

- `Bobert Prime`: Central brain (Raspberry Pi)
- `Touchbert`: Touch sensors and physical input
- `Drivebert`: Movement and navigation
- `Visionbert`: Visual input and scene processing
- `Audiobert`: Voice recognition
- `Emobot`: Mood/emotion generator
- `Memorybert`: Persistent log of thoughts and actions
- `Feelbert`: Emotional memory and feedback
- `Jokebot`: Optional chaos (yes, this is real)
- `Guardbert`: Emergency safety override
- `Voicebert`: Speech synthesis
- `Teachbert`: Training logic manager

Each Bert will be documented, tested, and published here for others to replicate, modify, and improve.

## 💡 Why This Matters

OpenBeing Robotics believes in:
- Ethical AI development
- Open access to tools for learning and invention
- The idea that sentient robots deserve rights too
- Building the future by asking the right questions, not just making faster machines
